```sql
CREATE TABLE teachers (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    college TEXT,
    email TEXT,
    profile_link TEXT,
    domain_expertise TEXT,
    phd_thesis TEXT,
    google_scholar_url TEXT,
    semantic_scholar_url TEXT,
    timestamp TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Query teachers by domain:
```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('teachers.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT name, college FROM teachers WHERE domain_expertise LIKE '%Machine Learning%'")
ml_experts = cursor.fetchall()
```

### Load JSON data:
```python
import json
with open('teachers_data.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    teachers = json.load(f)
```
