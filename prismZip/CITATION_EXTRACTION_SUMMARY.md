# Citation Extraction Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented citation extraction from Google Scholar profiles and integrated it with the API endpoints. This allows citation data (citations count, h-index, i10-index) to be displayed on teacher cards without requiring users to click on profiles.

## Implementation Details

1. **Citation Extraction**
   - Created `extract_citations.py` to handle the extraction of citation data from Google Scholar profiles
   - Implemented a background thread to extract and cache citation data
   - Used BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
   - Added caching mechanism with 24-hour expiry

2. **API Integration**
   - Modified `app.py` to start citation extraction on application startup
   - Enhanced `professor_routes.py` to include citation data in API responses
   - Added endpoints for citation status and refresh

3. **ID Mapping**
   - Fixed the mapping between database professor IDs and JSON teacher IDs
   - Created a more accurate mapping based on Google Scholar URLs and user IDs
   - Used the mapping to correctly link citation data with professors in API responses

4. **Testing**
   - Created test scripts to verify citation extraction and ID mapping
   - Added debugging tools to help identify and resolve issues
   - Confirmed citation data is correctly displayed in API responses

## Key Files Modified

- `extract_citations.py` - New file for citation extraction and caching
- `app.py` - Added background citation extraction
- `professor_routes.py` - Enhanced API endpoints with citation data
- `debug_id_mapping.py` - Created for testing and debugging ID mapping
- `update_professor_routes.py` - Used to update the ID mapping function

## How It Works

1. On application startup, a background thread is started to extract citation data from Google Scholar profiles
2. The citation data is cached in `teacher_citations_cache.json` with a 24-hour expiry
3. When API requests are made, the ID mapping function is used to map database professor IDs to JSON teacher IDs
4. The mapped IDs are used to retrieve citation data from the cache
5. The citation data is included in API responses for both professor listings and individual professor details

## Issues Solved

1. **ID Mapping Issue**
   - Database used numeric IDs (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - JSON file used alphanumeric IDs (f82927e5, 269d1df4, etc.)
   - Fixed by creating an accurate mapping between the two based on Google Scholar URLs

2. **Citation Extraction**
   - Implemented robust extraction with error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Added background processing to avoid blocking API requests
   - Included caching to minimize repeated extractions

## Next Steps

1. **UI Integration**
   - Update the frontend to display citation data on teacher cards
   - Add visual indicators for citation count, h-index, and i10-index
   - Implement sorting and filtering based on citation metrics

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Consider batch processing for citation extraction
   - Add more granular cache expiry based on last update time
   - Implement periodic background refreshes for citation data

3. **Additional Features**
   - Add trending analysis for citation growth over time
   - Include publication count and recent publications
   - Enhance search to include citation-based relevance
